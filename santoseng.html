					<b>The Chilean saints.</b>
				</div>
				<div id="texto">
					<p>They are that innumerable multitude of men and women, of all races, ages and conditions, who went out of their way for others, who overcame selfishness, who always forgave. And <b><font color="red">in Chile only two Saints were recognized by the Catholic Church</font></b>, which were <b><font color="red">Saint Teresa of the Andes</font></b> and <b><font color="red">San Alberto Hurtado.</font></b></p>
				</div>

					<b>San Alberto Hurtado:</b>
				</div>
				<div id="texto">
					<p><b><font color="red">Alberto Hurtado studied at the San Ignacio Jesuit College in Santiago de Chile</font></b>, where <b><font color="red" >he went to the Catholic University of the same city to study law</font></b>, which he finished in 1924. <b><font color="red">Shortly after he entered the Jesuit order as a novice </font></b>, in the house of formation that the order had in the <b><font color="red">city of Chillán.</font></b> After that, he went to Argentina, Spain and Belgium (University of Leuven) to complete his studies and religious formation. <b><font color="red">In 1933 he was ordained a priest.</font></b></p>

					<p>Back in Chile, <b><font color="red">in 1936 he began teaching at the university as a doctor in psychology and pedagogy. In 1942 he was appointed adviser in the youth area of ​​the organization Acción Católica</font></b>, with which <b><font color="red"> he traveled throughout the country founding youth assistance centers, without leaving virtually unvisited province.</font></b> Continuing with his social and catechetical work, <b><font color="red">in 1944 he founded the Hogar de Cristo</font></b>, center created with the purpose of giving shelter to the homeless. Because of his intense activity, Father Hurtado <b><font color="red"> would become known as "the priest of the poor."</font></b></p>

					<p>In 1948, when Marxist ideas threatened to spread through the unions to the most unprotected layers and the thriving Chilean working class, <b><font color="red">Alberto Hurtado created a Catholic union</font ></b>, Acción Sindical Chilena (ASICH), <b><font color="red">with the aim of resisting a political ideology</font></b> that went against the values ​​defended by the Catholic Church.</p>

					<p>Inspired by the doctrine of the encyclical Quadragesimo Anno, <b><font color="red">published several books and founded and directed the important magazine Mensaje, which is still published today</font></b> . His works include Is Chile a Catholic country?, Christian social humanism in the documents of the Catholic hierarchy, Unionism, history, theory and practice, The affective crisis of adolescence and The priestly crisis in Chile.</p>

					<p>In 1977, the Chilean Catholic Church carried out the first steps in the process for the beatification of Alberto Hurtado, which did not really begin its ordinary course until 1993, the date on which Pope John Paul II gave his approval of the report on the cause of beatification. <b><font color="red">On October 10, 1994, Alberto Hurtado was beatified by Pope John Paul II; eleven years later, in October 2005, he was canonized by Benedict XVI</font></b>. The festivity of San Alberto Hurtado is celebrated on August 18.</p>

						<div id="titulo1">
							<b>What did Alberto Hurtado do for others?</b>
						</div>
					<p>Along with denouncing the poor working conditions and the violation of child labor, <b><font color="red">he was a promoter and defender of the right to unionize workers and peasants.</font></b></p>

						<div id="titulo1">
							<b>The miracle of Alberto Hurtado:</b>
						</div>
					<p><b><font color="red">María Alicia began a miraculous stage of recovery that years later would become Father Alberto Hurtado's first miracle and opened the way for him to become the first Holy man born in Chile.</font></b></p>

					<p>“I was protected by God, because medicine had declared itself incompetent. According to the testimonies of the doctors, there was nothing to be done with me. <b><font color="red">All the human and scientific means available to medicine to save me had been exhausted</font></b>”, says María Alicia.</p>

					<p><b><font color="red">Given its severity, it was possible to perform an operation.</font></b></p>

					<p>At the same time, at Father Hurtado's tomb, a group of <b><font color="red">workers from the San Ignacio del Bosque school left a record in the petition book for the improvement of María Alicia. That same day, the fever that afflicted her began to go down</font></b> and, little by little, the symptoms began to disappear, <b><font color="red">which allowed her to be operated on.</font></b> The miracle had materialized</p>

						<div id="titulo1">
							<b>How did Saint Alberto Hurtado die?</b>
						</div>
					<p>Father Hurtado <b><font color="red">died on August 18, 1952, affected by pancreatic cancer when he was only fifty-one years old.</font></b> At the time of his death said the following <b><font color="red">"Give until it hurts".</font></b> Perhaps this phrase defines Padre Hurtado better than anything.</p>

					<b>Saint Teresa of the Andes:</b>
				</div>
				<div id="texto">
					<p>"Juana Fernández Solar; Santiago de Chile, 1900 - Los Andes, 1920" This young nun <b><font color="red">was the first Chilean saint of the Catholic Church belonging to the Discalced Carmelites .</font></b> From a very young age she had shown signs of her spirituality and wanted to receive Communion when she was only five years old, At six she promised to pray the rosary every day and at fourteen she sponsored a boy who had begged her for alms on the street.</p>

					<p>During her preparation for Carmel, on December 7, 1915, one day before her confessor allowed her to make her first vow of chastity, Juana wrote in her diary: "Tomorrow is the greatest day of my life. I am going to be the wife of Jesus. Who am I and who is He? The almighty, immense, Wisdom, Kindness and Purity itself is going to unite with a poor sinner. Oh Jesus, my love, my life, my consolation and joy, my everything! Tomorrow I will be yours! Oh Jesus, my love! My goodness, tomorrow I will be twice your daughter. I am going to be the Bride of Jesus. He is going to put the wedding ring on my finger. Oh, I am happy, for I can truly say that the only love of my heart has been Him."</p>

					<p><b><font color="red">Throughout his short life he suffered from various diseases, such as diphtheria and typhus. From the ages of 11 to 15, he suffered health disorders every December 8, being several times in danger of death.</font></b></p>

						<div id="titulo2">
							<p><b>What did he die of?</b></p>
						</div>
						<p>She had been in the convent for eleven months when <b><font color="red">she died of typhus and diphtheria</font></b> at 7:15 p.m. on April 12, 1920, at nineteen years. Before she died, she professed as a Carmelite nun in article mortis.</p>

						<div id="titulo2">
							<p><b>What was your miracle?</b></p>
						</div>
						<p>One of the best-known miracles attributed to Teresita is the case of the <b><font color="red">"Resurrected Firefighter".</font></b> On December 4, 1985, the volunteer of the Sixth Fire Company of Santiago, Héctor Uribe Carrasco, <b><font color="red">falls from a roof during a fire</font></b> and also receives an electric shock.Doctors <b ><font color="red">They declare him "clinically dead".</font></b> His companions and his mother commend Saint Therese. <b><font color="red">They put a relic of the Saint on his chest</font></b> and a few minutes later, Héctor Uribe <b><font color="red">begins to have signs vital</font></b>, finally surviving the accident.</p>
